<h1> A little more about me
</h1>
<p>
	I grew up in Cambridge, MA and lived in Boston, MA most my life. I stayed in school in Cambridge when my family moved to Boston, either commuting from Boston or living with my aunt who lived in Cambridge. I started off in Cambridge Longfellow School, then graduated to Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. After High School Graduation I attend College for awhile but drop out to start working. I've held a few different roles in my life but now i'm a Camera Operator (mostly for the local community access network) Boston Neighborhood Network (BNN), and freelance AV (Audio-Visual) Tech.

<h2>
	Sports
</h2>

<p>
	Sports are a big part of me, I love basketball, boxing, and football. I'm also a big homer so needless to say the Celtics and Patriots are my two faviort teams. Now boxing on the other hand I became a fan of as a child from my uncles, some of them where amature boxers so their love of it transfer over to me.

<h3>
	Boston Teams
</h3>

<p>
	Obviously growing up in Boston I will be natural drawn to the hometown teams and that was the case. I always played basketball as a child and got into the NBA during the end of the Bird era. If your fimiliar with that time frame you will know that was the dark era of Celtics basketball.
